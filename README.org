* Introduction 

- land on a new country
- you are a linguist
- you have a laptop with you
- want to understand the local language
- but you have nothing
- if you meet a local linguist, then you could sit together and write a grammar
- if you are lucky to get a dictionary, then you can propagate labels from the one language to the local one
- if you have a corpus, then you can go for fully unsupervised learning
- if you find out that the local language is similar to yours, then you could try to use DIRECTLY your resources for the local one
- anyway, you need something.
